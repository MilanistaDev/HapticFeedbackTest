There is an input form on the screen, and input restriction is 1 to 10 characters.
When it becomes 8 characters, the device returns feedback of "Warning" to the user.
Return "Failure" feedback when it is 10 characters or 12 characters.
If you tap the send button with 1 to 10 characters entered, "Success" feedback is returned on success.
On the other hand, if it fails, it will return "Failure" feedback.
